## Visitation Info

The Islamic Center of San Diego is open for visits from people of all faiths.

Please note that shoes should be worn when entering Offices and the Library and while participating in activities held in the facility's Multi-Purpose room.

In the Islamic tradition, men and women do not shake hands when introduced to each other.

Also, there is a separate prayer hall upstairs for women while the prayer hall for men is located downstairs.

Finally, all visitors must dress modestly and it is considered respectful for women to wear a headscarf, although it is not required.

Please check with the Administration Office upon entering the Center.

For large groups, please call or email the Center prior to visiting, so we can better serve you.

We look forward to hosting you and others in the spirit of brotherhood, peace, and unity.
