This section quotes several verses from the old and new testaments regarding Jesus (peace be upon him). Please read the section titled” Jesus in Islam” before reading this section.

### Jesus never said in the Bible that: “I am God, worship me”
Jesus taught oneness of God:
And Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord” (Mark 12:29)

Jesus Called God as the only true God:
“And this is eternal life, that they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (John 17:3)

Jesus said unto her, “Touch me not [don’t hold onto me]; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God (John 20:17)

“You have heard how I said unto you, ‘I go away, and come again unto you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I’” (John 14:28)

Jesus prayed to God:
And he went a little farther, and fell on his face [to the ground], and prayed, saying, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass [taken] from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.” (Matthew 26:39)

And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46)

And he [Jesus] withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed (Luke 5:16)

Jesus’s power and authority came from God:
 “I can of mine[my] own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine[my] own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me (John 5:30)
 
“But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do [I do exactly what my father commands me]” (John 14:31)

### What Jesus did say
## Jesus said that he was the **Prophet** of God:
And they were offended by him. But Jesus said unto them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country [town], and in his own house.” (Matthew 13:57)

“Nevertheless, I must walk today, and tomorrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perishes outside of Jerusalem. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which [you who] kill the prophets, and stone them [those] that are sent to you . . .” (Luke 13:33-34)

For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country (John 4:44)

“The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus; whom you delivered up [handed over to be killed]” (Acts 3:13)

“You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, was a man approved by God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in your midst, as you yourselves also know” (Acts 2:22)

 “For of a truth [to conspire] against your holy servant Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,” (Acts 4:27)
 
He [Jesus] said: 
>"I am indeed a servant of Allah: He has given me revelation and made me a prophet.” (Qur’an 19:30)

### How many Gods? One? Two? Three?
## Christians cite:
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1&14) [1] 

[1] These statements were not made by Jesus Christ, nor were they attributed to him by the author of Gospel According to John. Therefore, they do not constitute evidence for Jesus’s divinity especially considering the doubts held by Christian scholars about the fourth Gospel. The Bible scholars who authored “The five Gospels” said: “the two pictures painted by John and the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) cannot both be historically accurate.” (see Robert W. Funk, The Five Gospels p.10). Also see the Greek definition of logos (translated as ‘word’ in these verses), and its history. (The New encyclopedia Britannica, vol. 7, p440 and vol. 9, p386). Word is not the “logos” or second person as Godhead. It is the creative command of God or “be”.

## What about the following?
“As concerning therefore, the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.” (1 Corinthians 8:4)

For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; (1 Timothy 2:5)

“Know therefore this day, and take to heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is no other.” (Deuteronomy 4:39)
 
“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord” (Deuteronomy 6:4)

They surely disbelieve who say: 
>“Lo! God is the Messiah, son of Mary”. The Messiah (himself) said: “O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord” (Qur’an 5:72)

“Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord; neither are there any works like your works. All nations whom you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord; and shall glorify your name. For you are great, and do wondrous things: you alone are God” (Psalms 86:8-10)

Thus, said the Lord the King of Israel, and redeemer the Lord [Almighty] of hosts; “I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.” (Isaiah 44:6)

For thus saith the Lord -that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he has established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited- [He says]: “I am the Lord; and there is none else [no other].” (Isaiah 45:18)

And many more; Exodus 8:10, II Samuel 7:22, I Kings 8:23, Psalms 113:5, Isaiah 43:10-11 

>“The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: "Be". And he was” (Qur’an 3:59)

>“[Jesus said] ‘Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord therefore worship Him. That is the Straight Path’” (Qur’an 19:36)

### Jesus- Son of God?
## Christians cite:
And a voice from heaven, said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Matthew 3:17)

## How about others mentioned as ‘Son(s)’ or ‘First Born’ in the Bible?
[Israel]: And you shall say unto Pharaoh, “This is what the Lord says: Israel is my son, even my firstborn” (Exodus 4:22)

[Solomon]: “He [Solomon] shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever. (I Chronicles 22:10, II Samuel 7:13-14)

[People]: “You are the children of the Lord your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”. (Deuteronomy 14:1)

[People]: And I will be a Father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty” (II Corinthians 6:18) 

[Israel and Ephraim]: “They shall come with weeping, and with supplications as I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn” (Jeremiah 31:9)

[David]: I will declare the decree: the Lord said unto me [David], “You are my Son; this day have I become your father” (Psalms 2:7)

[Peace makers]: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” (Matthew 5:9)

[Melchizedek the Priest]: For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, . . . Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; remains a priest continually [forever]. (Hebrews 7:1-3)

“Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.” (Luke 3:38)

## Is the meaning of “Son” literal or metaphoric (to anyone beloved by God)? 
Jesus said: “That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.  . . .  Be therefore perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:45-48)

And demons also came out of many [people], crying out, and saying, “You are the Son of God”. And he rebuking them not allowing them to speak for they knew that he was Christ. (Luke 4:41)

### One with God or One with People?
**Christians cite John 10:30 and say Jesus and God were not separate, but one and the same God incarnate: “I and my Father are one.” (John 10:30)**

Jews accused him of claiming divinity based on John 10:30, Jesus answered them: 

“I have said, You are gods; and all of you are children of the most High” (Psalm 82:6),  “Jesus answered them, ‘Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?’”(John 10:34)

Christians add: “Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father [is] in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells [lives] in me, who does his works . . . “ (John 14:10-11)

**Can we ignore the rest of the same Gospel? How about Jesus being one and the same with others?**

“At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.” (John 14:20)

“Neither [my] pray is for these alone, but for those also who shall believe in me through their word [message]; That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I am in you, that they also may be in us: [so] that the world may believe that you have sent me”. (John 17:20-21)

“And now I am no longer in the world, but these are [they are still] in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep them through power of your name, the name you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are [one]” (John 17:11)

Do above verses point to a symbolic statement to mean oneness of purpose, or oneness of essence?

### Jesus was the expected Messiah, a Prophet
**Later people elevated Jesus from a teacher, a Prophet, to “Son of God”, “Lord”, and finally “God” himself? How does Bible define him?**

[A teacher]: The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him: “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher [who has] come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, if God was not with him” (John 3:2)

[A man]: “You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, was a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you [which God did among you through him], as you yourselves also know (Acts 2:22) 

[A Prophet]: Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed, they said: “[surely] This is the prophet who is to come into the world.” (John 6:14)

[A Prophet]: And the multitude [crowd] said, “This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.” (Matthew 21:11)

See also, John 7:40, Acts, 2:22, 3:13, 22-23, Luke 7:16, 24:19, 9:22, and 4:41 

### Who will come after him?
## Jesus Prophesied
“Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient [good] for you that I go away: for if I don’t go away, the Comforter [2] [Advocate] will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he comes, he will reprove [reproach] the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment” (John 16:7-8)

“I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. But when he, the Spirit of truth [2], comes, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself [speak on his own]; but he will speak only what he hears: and he will tell you about things to come. He shall glorify me . . .”  (John 16:12-14) 

“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter [2] [advocate], that he may abide with you [help you and be with you] forever” (John 14:16)

“be with you forever” could be interpreted to mean that there would be no need for additional prophets to succeed this Comforter, Counselor or Advocate, he would be the last of the prophets of God.

[2] The Greek word “paraclete” is translated as “Comforter” in the KJV, and “Advocate” or “Helper” or “Counselor” in other translations. However, some erroneously translated as “The Holy Spirit”, However the term “another” in John 14:16 implies that it will be someone else like Jesus (one more of the same kind), and not the Holy Spirit. The term “Counselor” could not be referring to the Holy Spirit here because according to Gospels the Holy Spirit was already present in the world prior to Jesus’s birth (see John the Baptist filled with Holy Spirit (Luke 1:15), Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:41), Zacharias was also filled with the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:67)).

**Who was the promised Prophet the Jewish people were expecting?**
And this is the record [testimony] of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed [freely], “I am not the Christ”.  And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elias?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” And he answered, “No”. (John 1:19-21)   

**Who was “the Prophet” the Jews were asking about?**      
“I will raise them up a Prophet like you from among their brethren [3] and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him [call to account].” (Deuteronomy 18:18-19) 

“Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen one in whom I delight; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth justice to the Gentiles [nations]. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he has established justice on earth: and the isles shall wait for his law. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, let the settlements where Kedar [3] lives rejoice…” (Isaiah 42:1,4,11)

[3] Ismael was Issacs’s brother and his decedents are brethren (in Deuteronomy 18:18-19) or fellow Israelites.   The most mentioned among Ismael’s twelve sons is Qaydar (Kedar in Hebrew). In some Bible verses, Qaydar is synonymous with Arabs in general (Jeremiah 2:10, Ezekiel 27:21, Isaiah 60:7), from whom Prophet Muhammad was and a decedent of Ismael
