---
Al Rashid School is the weekend learning program at the Islamic Center of San Diego and has been in operation for over 30 years.

We are dedicated to providing young Muslims the opportunity to have quality learning in Quran, Arabic, and Islamic Studies.

Classes are held on Saturdays during two sessions: Arabic Speaking students from 10 am -12 am and for non-Arabic speaking students from 2pm - 4 pm.

Given the current circumstances, classes will be held online until further notice.
