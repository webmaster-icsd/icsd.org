Al Rashid School is the weekend learning program at the Islamic Center of San Diego and has been in operation for over 30 years.

We are dedicated to providing young Muslims the opportunity to have quality learning in Quran, Arabic, and Islamic Studies.

Al Rashid School online classes will begin on September 11, 2021, for students 6 to 18 years of age.  
Students who are 6 and 7 years old must provide a birth certificate at registration.  

Classes are held on Saturdays during two sessions:  
- Arabic Speaking students from 10am-12:30pm  
- non-Arabic speaking students from 2pm-4:30pm

Due to concerns about the childrenâ€™s safety and in light of the latest update on the SDUSD guidelines, Al Rashid School will remain virtual at least until December 2021.
