The Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, based on the decision of the Fiqh Council of North America, is pleased to announce that the dates of Ramadan and Eidul Fitr for the year 2021/1442 AH are expected to be as follows, insha'Allah:  

Ramadan 1442 AH:  

The Astronomical New Moon is on Monday, April 12, 2021, at 2:33 Universal Time. On that day, everywhere in North and South America at sunset, the elongation is at least 8 degrees and the moon is at least 5 degrees above the sun. Therefore, the first day of Ramadan 1442 is on Tuesday, April 13, 2021, insha’Allah. Tarawih prayer will start on Monday night April 12.   

Eidul Fitr 1442 AH:  

The Astronomical New Moon is on Tuesday, May 11, 2021, at 19:02 Universal Time. On that day there is no place on earth where at sunset the elongation is 8 degrees and the moon is 5 degrees above the sun. Therefore Shawwal 1442 cannot start the next day. Hence the first day of Shawwal is on Thursday, May 13, 2021, insha’Allah. Eidul Fitr will be on Thursday, May 13, 2021.  

Stay tuned for more info about Ramadan coming soon, inshaAllah!
