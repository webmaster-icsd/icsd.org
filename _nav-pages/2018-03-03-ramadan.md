### Ramadan Appeal: Islamic Center of San Diego is in need of funds. Goal: $250,000 

Every year, the Islamic Center of San Diego (ICSD) has its only annual fundraiser in Ramadan. This year is different and we need your support now more than before.

Onsite donations, Friday lunches, Masjid store sales, Saturday school fees have contributed to the revenue stream in the past. Due to COVID-19 shutdown these revenue streams have stopped.

Your donations (online and in person checks/cash) are the only source of revenue right now. And, we are running well short on our annual budget. Please donate generously and support your Masjid. Your Masjid needs you!
