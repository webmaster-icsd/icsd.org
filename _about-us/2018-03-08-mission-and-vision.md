Welcome to the Islamic Center of San Diego! The ICSD resides in the heart of Clairemont and is the largest Mosque in San Diego County. Our mission statement is to serve the religious needs of the San Diego Muslim population and work with the larger community to serve the less fortunate, to educate, and to better our nation. The regular activities held at ICSD are the five daily prayers, Friday prayer and sermon, and a variety of educational talks and seminars. We also work with other Mosques in San Diego county in sponsoring and holding events for the local Muslim community. In addition to these programs, ICSD is increasingly branching out in working with other San Diego organizations for social causes of interest to all people of faith. We hope that you enjoy our website and thank you again for your honored presence!
