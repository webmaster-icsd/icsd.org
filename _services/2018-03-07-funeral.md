- Ghusl (the ritual body bathing)

Guide lines to establish Islamic Burial  
To establish an Islamic Burial there are two issues to deal with  
    (1) Mortuary service  
-This service includes transportation of the body from the place of death to the mortuary facility where the preparation of the body for burial (washing & Kafan) is done.  
-Also getting the burial permit from the county of SD  
-Then transporting the body to the cemetery for burial & providing the family with the death certificate later.  

ICSD is using Bishop Mortuary For this Service.  
Their phone # is: (619)466-4462, Manager (Gwen)  
Address: 3444 Citrus St., Lemon Grove, CA 91945  

    (2) Cemetery service  
-The family of the deceased have to establish a grave at a cemetery.  
ICSD acquired some graves at a cemetery called  
La Vista Memorial Park in National City  
Al Rahma Garden, ICSD Section.  
3191 Orange St., National City, CA 91950  
Phone: (619)475-7770  

-If the family doesnâ€™t have a reserved grave at any other cemetery and they need a grave at La Vista,  
They need to contact Br Mohamed Kamel-(619)518-1265
