## Guide lines to establish Islamic Burial  

To establish an Islamic Burial there are two issues to deal with  

(1) Mortuary service  
-This service includes transportation of the body from the place of death to the mortuary facility where the preparation of the body for burial (washing & Kafan) is done.  
-Also getting the burial permit from the county of SD  
-Then transporting the body to the cemetery for burial & providing the family with the death certificate later.  

ICSD is using Bishop Mortuary for this Service.  
Phone number: (619)466-4462, Manager (Gwen)  
Address: 3444 Citrus St., Lemon Grove, CA 91945   
    

(2) Cemetery service  
-The family of the deceased need to establish a grave at a cemetery.  



### Very Important:  
Please consider wearing a face mask   
& maintaining social distance
