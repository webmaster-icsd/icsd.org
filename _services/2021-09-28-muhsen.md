The Islamic Center of San Diego is proud to announce its collaboration with MUHSEN, a nonprofit organization serving Muslims with special needs. We hope our partnership will bring more inclusivity and understanding, as well as bridge the gaps between the Muslim and special needs community.  

We will be working with MUHSEN in providing a number of services and programs. To better understand your needs and help us in our efforts, please fill out the survey below.
