## Activities
There are various regular activities held at ICSD throughout the week. See the ICSD calendar for details. More information on some of the activities can be found below.

### Lectures and Study Circles
We hold a number of lectures and study circles throughout the week. See the activities calendar for the current schedule.

### Saturday School
We hold a comprehensive Saturday school to provide our children with basic Islamic education. The subjects covered include Quran, Islamic Studies, and Arabic language instruction. The ages of the students range from six to eighteen. The school is held in two sessions due to the large number of students. See the activities calendar for details.

### Youth Group
Our Mission is to develop, through knowledge and practice, committed young Muslim men and women capable of spreading and giving root to a comprehensive understanding of Islam and to prepare them to be at the forefront in the development of their communities.

Our youth group is divided into three groups. Group A is for ages 7-10, Group B is for ages 11-13, and Group C is for ages 14-18. The latter group is run by dedicated Muslim college students.

We meet EVERY Friday at ICSD from 7:30PM to 9:30PM
