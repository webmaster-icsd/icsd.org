## Al Rashid Weekend School
Dear Al Rashid School Families,  
Out of an abundance of caution for our students and teachers and in following the direction of the Islamic Center of San Diego (ICSD), the Al Rashid School will be closing effective immediately and until further notice.  There will be NO classes beginning this Saturday, March 14th. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation, and may Allah protect our families and community.
