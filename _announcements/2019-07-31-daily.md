## Urgent Appeal: Islamic Center Of San Diego Needs Your Support
The current sewage infrastructure of ICSD has disintegrated over the years through corrosion and buildup due to its age and high usage. [Repairing it will require multiple sites to be dug and new pipes to be laid down where the old ones have been completely damaged.](http://www.icsd.org/events/sewer-infrastructure-project) It is essential that we address these repairs with a sense of urgency to avoid any major damage and to continue providing sanitary functioning system for all. 

Please help us repair the sewer infrastructure of ICSD building under the wudu area. The cost of the project is $60000. https://goodbricksapp.com/icsd.org/cause/operations
