## CURRENT ICSD REGULATIONS
ICSD has temporarily suspended the social distancing requirement in accordance with local health guidelines, but MASKS are still REQUIRED in ICSD and prayer rugs are highly recommended.  
Registration is not required for Jumuah at this time.  
(Please keep in mind that ICSD may need to go back to distancing if the situation changes.)
