## Interfaith Shelter Jan 28 - Feb 11
This year the Shelter starts on 1/28/2023 to host and feed the homeless population (enrolled in the program) between Jan 28 to Feb 11.  
This program is part of the San Diego Interfaith Shelter Network www.interfaithshelter.org, ICSD will provide overnight volunteers for night shifts (7 nights) at the shelter, in addition to this we’ll also provide dinner for 5 nights.  
Alhamdulillah, ICSD has been involved in the interfaith shelter for many years with different Churches and the shelter is resuming after taking a break during COVID. Like last years, we’ll be teaming up with Clairemont Covenant Church. This is a great opportunity for us as Muslims to serve the needy in our San Diego community.  
**As an overnight host Volunteer, You will get a separate guest room to sleep during the night and your responsibilities will be to oversee everything is going smooth, wake the guests up at 6 am, setup
