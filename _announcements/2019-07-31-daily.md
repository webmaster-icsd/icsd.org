## Assisting Muslim students with issues related to online learning  
The transition to online learning has been very challenging for families. Many students have limited access to internet and digital devices, limited language proficiency and limited capability to work self-reliantly without support or supervision.  
The isolation caused by the pandemic has probably deepened the home language for English learners and diminished English language exposure. Many English learner students donâ€™t have the opportunity to practice their English with a fluent English speaker while social distancing without daily teacher interactions.
Although school districts managed to give to students devices and internet access, limited instruction was provided during the school closures and English language proficiency could have decreased.  
The Islamic Center of San Diego created a HELPLINE to aid Muslim students by answering their questions on the technical issues, access to curriculum, tutoring, mental health services.........etc.
